# EcoRoute 

A Green-Delivery project built by beta09 team Hack Horizon.

EcoRoute is an eco-friendly last-mile delivery platform. Our mission is to decrease carbon emissions as much as possible by providing users with the most efficient routes based on their preferences. We compare various paths to suggest the best possible route.

## Features

1. **Optimized Route Suggestions**:
   - Users provide basic delivery details such as:
     - Delivery location
     - Type of vehicle (e.g., car, bike, truck)
     - Type of fuel (petrol, diesel, or electric)
     - Delivery mode (fast, eco, balanced, slow)
   - Based on these details, our algorithm suggests routes and calculates carbon emissions, total distance, and estimated time for each path.

2. **User-Friendly Dashboard**:
   - **Profile Section**: Displays user information.
   - **Bar Chart**: Compares estimated times for various routes.
   - **User Activity Section**: Shows total distance, estimated time, and carbon emissions for the user.
   - **Doughnut Chart**: Visualizes potential carbon savings when following our recommended eco-friendly route.
   - **Dynamic Route Finder**: Provides users with different routes from their location and displays them on a map with polylines.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - The dashboard displays key metrics in graphs and charts, including a map with polylines for route options, allowing users to analyze their impact and choose the best route.
